Finding Cheryl was simple and pain free; and our wedding was straight from a bridal magazine! My husband and I could not have asked for anything more. Thank you to Cheryl for making our day unforgettable. And thank you Wedding Gram for making it easy for us to find the perfect Wedding Planner. It was a match made in heaven! "
