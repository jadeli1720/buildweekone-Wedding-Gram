# Build Week Project-Wedding-Gram

This repository was created from a Build Week Project that I built with 5 of my fellow Lambda Students. As one of three of the User Interface developers, I worked with them to create a landing page for a website called Wedding Gram. In this repository, I have decided to rework and experiment with various components of the website and add pages as my skills as a developer progresses.

### About:
Wedding Gram is a service designed for Wedding Planners and newly-engaged Couples. Wedding Planners can log in, create a simple post about a wedding event, and then share it without needing to share too much info. Couples can browse all of these posted events to get ideas aboutfor their own wedding to plan.

When not logged in, you can view the Home, Login, and Register pages. After loggin in or registering as a user, You can view your personal dashboard to Add/Edit/Delete posts.
